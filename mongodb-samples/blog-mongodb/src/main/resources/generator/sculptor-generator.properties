#
# Customized properties for the Sculptor generator.
#
# In this file you can define customized properties
# for the generator. By default the properties in 
# default-sculptor-generator.properties are used,
# but you can override the properties by defining 
# them in this file. Only the properties you need 
# to change need to be defined here.
#
# Look in default-sculptor-generator.properties
# in sculptor-generator to see 
# what properties are available.
